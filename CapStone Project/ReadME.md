**Seismic Event Prediction. (Earth Quake prediction)**

This project predict the depth of a event with the data details using machine learning techniques, with a specific data set of maximum information available and that might plays a significant role in impact assessment, emergency response, infrastructure design, and scientific research.

**Data Sources**

**Model Selection**
Model trailed with RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, XGBRegressor, CatBoostRegressor.

**Evaluation**
the RandomForestRegressor proved to be the most effective. It achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error (0.380246), Mean Squared Error (0.407652), and Root Mean Squared Error (0.638476), along with the highest R2 Score (79.004779), indicating its superior predictive accuracy and reliability.
